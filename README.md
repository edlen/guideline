mulitple tabelviews
So this is my first attempt at creating an app with multiple tableviews 
Unfortunately I'm quite new at this and the app doesn't actually run!! 
My aim here is to create an outline of what it is that I'm aiming to create and ask for help off more clever people than myself!!
Already there are quite a few view controllers and I havent even accounted for all the various options. 
If there was anyway of doing this short in code that would be brilliant! 
The only thing is though that the final screen must be able to be individualised with text as this screen will be the final option for 
treatment 

Any help that anyone could offer me would be really really appreciated! 
I'm still very new at this whole thing so please feel free to speak VERY slowly and repeat yourself often if you have any suggestions for code!
